[`John D. Carmack`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack) said, "In the information age, the barriers to entry into programming just aren't there. The barriers are self imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers."
